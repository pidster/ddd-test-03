# DDD with AI Agent Coding Assistants: VS Code + GitHub Copilot

This repo aims to provide a demo of the strengths and weaknesses of AI coding assistants.

## VS Code + GitHub Copilot

TODO a summary

## Objectives

Start with the initial fixed prompt below, thereafter respond to the conversation. The objectives are as follows:

1. Extract details from the JPEG and create DDD design artifacts
2. Create an application architecture using the DDD design artifacts
3. Ask the AI for engineering implementation advice
4. Accept the advice (and if the AI doesn't start coding, ask it to)
5. Make a drink and see what happens

### Starting Prompt

```
This is a diagram produced in a Domain Driven Design modelling workshop. Please extract content from the image, and convert it to Markdown documents, using Mermaid for the diagrams.
