# Insurance Claim Process - Event Storming Overview

This document presents the key findings from our Domain-Driven Design event storming session for the insurance claim processing workflow.

## What is Event Storming?

Event Storming is a collaborative modeling technique that brings together domain experts and technical team members to explore complex business domains. Using a simple visual language of colored sticky notes, participants map out the flow of domain events, commands, aggregates, user roles, and identify key issues or questions.

## Color Legend

In our session, we used the following color coding:

- **Orange** - Domain Events (something significant that happened)
- **Blue** - Commands (actions that trigger changes)
- **Yellow** - Aggregates (clusters of domain objects treated as a unit)
- **Yellow (with person icon)** - User Roles (actors in the system)
- **Pink** - Issues/Questions (areas needing further discussion)

## Key Process Overview

The event storming session revealed a complete insurance claim lifecycle:

1. **Claim Submission** - Customer initiates a claim online or by mail
2. **Documentation Verification** - Admin checks for completeness
3. **Insurance Verification** - Claims department assesses validity
4. **Decision Point** - Either approve and schedule payment or reject
5. **Payment Processing** - For approved claims
6. **Notification** - Customer informed of outcome

## Strategic Design Questions

During the session, we identified important questions about context boundaries:
- Should this process be realized within the existing Policy Management Context?
- Or should it be its own Bounded Context?

These questions will require further discussion with domain experts before finalizing the architecture.
