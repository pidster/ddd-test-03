## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| Integration challenges with Policy Management | High | Medium | Early proof-of-concept, develop Anti-Corruption Layer |
| Performance issues with event sourcing | High | Medium | Performance testing early, optimize read models |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Low | Regular security audits, SAST/DAST in CI/CD |
| Team skill gaps in DDD/CQRS | Medium | Medium | Training sessions, pair programming, architecture reviews |
| Scope creep | High | High | Regular backlog refinement, strong product ownership |
| Third-party payment provider issues | High | Medium | Adapter pattern, fallback mechanisms, circuit breakers |

## Technical Debt Strategy

We acknowledge that some technical debt is inevitable. Our approach is to:

1. **Identify and track**: All technical debt must be documented in JIRA with the "tech-debt" label
2. **Assess impact**: Categorize as "critical", "major", or "minor" based on impact
3. **Allocate time**: Dedicate 20% of each sprint to addressing technical debt
4. **Prioritize**: Address critical debt immediately, schedule others based on impact
5. **Prevent**: Regular architecture reviews to prevent unnecessary debt

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a strategic guide for the development of the Insurance Claim Processing System. It will be reviewed and updated quarterly to reflect progress, changing requirements, and new insights.

The VP of Engineering and Solution Architect will oversee the implementation of this roadmap, with regular updates to stakeholders. Team leads are responsible for tracking progress against their respective milestones and raising potential risks or blockers early.
